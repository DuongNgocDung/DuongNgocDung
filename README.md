- 👋 Hi, I’m Dương Ngọc Dung - a web developer. I'm good at self-learning, also a work lover. My goal is becoming extremely success in my career (as a developer).
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, manga, coding, traveling, shopping,...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, with a little of linux just bc I found that I'm so into working with linux recently. 
Besides I'm learning Japanese, too, but most time by watching anime :)))
